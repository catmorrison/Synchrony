# Synchrony-project

Code for 'Population and demographic synchrony in European land birds'

Code/

Code to make correlograms and estimate strength and relative scale of synchrony:

1 - Detrending_count.R, Detrending_productivity.R, Detrending_survival.R - calls bayesian survival models in: annual_survival_model_fixed.txt and annual_survival_model.txt

R code to create detrended estimates of annual variation in productivity.

2 - Pairs.R

R code to calculate pearsons correlations between all pairs of 100km squares.

3 - Correlograms.R

R code to calculate spatially explict correlograms

4 - Add wavelet code.

Example data files to make correlograms and estimate strength, relative scale and timescale of synchrony.
